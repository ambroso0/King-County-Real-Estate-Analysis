# King-County-Real-Estate-Analysis

This study was conducted to explore the relationship between the price of homes in
King County, Washington and their location and various property attributes. For this real estate
analysis, I used the dataset “House Sales in King County, USA” found on Kaggle, which
contained real estate data for over 21,000 homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015 in
King County, Washington. The dataset provided numerous characteristics for each home,
including but not limited to the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and stories, the square footage
of the property’s interior living space and square footage of the property’s lot, waterfront status,
a qualitative score for the quality of view from the property, and a qualitative score for the
condition of the home. In this report, the methods and approaches used to
analyze and assess the relationships existing between the selling price of homes and their
various property characteristics will be discussed along with any statistical findings.
